## Purpose

The **Smart Contract Vulnerabilities Archive** serves as a centralized hub for exploring, reporting, and staying updated on Web3 application threats. This repository is crucial for web security professionals and enthusiasts who are dedicated to enhancing the security and robustness of smart contract systems.

## Objectives

- **Centralize Knowledge:** Provide a comprehensive repository of known vulnerabilities related to EVM-compatible smart contracts.
- **Enhance Awareness:** Offer insights into common vulnerabilities and real-world cases to improve understanding and awareness.
- **Support Mitigation Efforts:** Share best practices and mitigation strategies to prevent exploitation of vulnerabilities.
- **Encourage Collaboration:** Foster a collaborative environment for reporting and discussing security issues with community and industry experts.

## Modules

The archive is organized into two main modules:

### 1. Smart Contract Vulnerabilities (SCVs)

This module presents an extensive compilation of known vulnerabilities specific to EVM-compatible smart contracts. It categorizes and provides insights into various security risks and weaknesses.

#### Overview of SCVs

<Accordion title="Vulnerability Types">
  <Card>
    ### Reentrancy Attacks
    Reentrancy attacks occur when a smart contract makes an external call to another contract, which can then re-enter the calling contract and perform unintended actions.

    **Example:** [DAO Hack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DAO_%28organization%29)

    **Mitigation:**
    - Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern.
    - Implement reentrancy guards.
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Integer Overflow/Underflow
    This vulnerability arises when arithmetic operations exceed the storage size of the data type.

    **Example:** [Parity Wallet Hack](https://blog.parity.io/parity-multisig-wallet-safety-issue)

    **Mitigation:**
    - Use SafeMath library for arithmetic operations.
    - Implement explicit overflow checks.
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Front-Running
    Front-running occurs when an attacker sees a pending transaction and submits their own transaction to exploit the situation.

    **Example:** [Uniswap V2 Exploit](https://medium.com/@patrick.urich/understanding-uniswap-v2-front-running-vulnerability-29efddc58938)

    **Mitigation:**
    - Use commit-reveal schemes.
    - Employ transaction ordering strategies.
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Denial of Service (DoS)
    Denial of Service vulnerabilities occur when an attacker can make a contract unusable by consuming all its resources.

    **Example:** [Ethereum Name Service (ENS) DoS](https://medium.com/@gobitfly/ethereum-name-service-doa-analysis-1b4d29b40c26)

    **Mitigation:**
    - Implement fail-safe mechanisms.
    - Optimize contract logic to minimize resource consumption.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

### 2. Real World Cases Registry

This module provides real-world examples illustrating vulnerabilities identified within EVM-compatible smart contracts. Each case demonstrates specific instances where vulnerabilities have been observed, categorized, and analyzed for better understanding and mitigation strategies.

#### Overview of Real World Cases

<Accordion title="Case Studies">
  <Card>
    ### Case Study: The DAO Hack
    **Date:** June 17, 2016  
    **Description:** A vulnerability in The DAO allowed an attacker to recursively withdraw funds, resulting in a significant loss.

    **Impact:** Loss of $50 million in Ether.

    **Analysis:** The attack exploited a reentrancy vulnerability in the smart contract.

    **Mitigation:** The Ethereum community implemented a hard fork to reverse the transaction and prevent similar attacks.
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Case Study: Parity Wallet Multi-Sig Bug
    **Date:** November 6, 2017  
    **Description:** A bug in the Parity multi-signature wallet contract led to the accidental freezing of funds.

    **Impact:** $150 million worth of Ether was frozen.

    **Analysis:** The issue was caused by a bug in the wallet's code, leading to unintentional lockout of funds.

    **Mitigation:** Update and review of the multi-sig wallet contract, along with additional auditing.
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Case Study: Uniswap V2 Front-Running Vulnerability
    **Date:** August 2020  
    **Description:** A vulnerability in Uniswap V2 allowed attackers to front-run trades and exploit price slippage.

    **Impact:** Loss of funds due to exploited price differences.

    **Analysis:** The vulnerability was related to the timing of transaction execution.

    **Mitigation:** Implementation of improved transaction ordering strategies and commit-reveal schemes.
  </Card>

  <Card>
    ### Case Study: ENS Denial of Service Attack
    **Date:** February 2021  
    **Description:** Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the ENS contract to disrupt its services.

    **Impact:** Temporary disruption of ENS services.

    **Analysis:** The vulnerability was due to resource exhaustion.

    **Mitigation:** Optimization of contract logic and introduction of fail-safe mechanisms.
  </Card>
</Accordion>

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

If you encounter a vulnerability or believe you've discovered an issue related to EVM compatible smart contracts, we encourage you to report it. Your contributions help improve the security of the entire ecosystem.

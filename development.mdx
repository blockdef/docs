We welcome contributions from developers and security researchers of all skill levels. Whether you want to report a bug, suggest a new feature, improve the documentation, or write code, your contributions are invaluable. Hereâ€™s how you can get started:

<Info>
  **Prerequisite** You should have installed Node.js (version 18.10.0 or
  higher).
</Info>

Step 1. Clone the BLOCKEF repository:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
git clone https://github.com/blockdef/web3-security-testing-guide.git
```

</CodeGroup>

Or using GitHub CLI:

```bash
gh repo clone blockdef/web3-security-testing-guide
```


Step 2. Installing dependencies once in the project's root directory, run the following command to install the project's dependencies:

```bash pnpm
pnpm install
```

Step 3. After installing the dependencies once in the project's root directory, run the following command to start the project:

```bash pnpm
pnpm run dev

### Custom Ports

BLOCKDEF uses port 3000 by default. You can use the `--port` flag to customize the port the repository runs on.
